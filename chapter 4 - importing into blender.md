# overview
After you finish the last step in this chapter, you're going to notice that everything is untextured. This is expected, and it sucks. You'll find out why later.

# process
1. Open `Blender`
2. `File` > `Import` > `Wavefront (.obj)`
3. Select both the `.obj` and `.mtl` files you exported from `Forza Studio`
4. Check the `Split By Object` option in the import menu, or else everything in the track will be combined into one huge object in Blender
5. Click `Import Wavefront OBJ`
